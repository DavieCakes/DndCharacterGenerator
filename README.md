## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the only hard requirement, and is used to manage the other dependencies (which may be viewed under package.json).

### Installing

Once NPM is installed, you can install the dependencies from the project directory with the command:

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

The project uses Jest as a unit test runner. You can run the tests from the project directory using an npm script:

```
npm test
```

When evoked, Jest will display options for running unit tests.

## Deployment

Deploying to a test/localhost environment is done via an npm script:

```
npm start
```
